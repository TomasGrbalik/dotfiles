## General

## Some random stuff from past todo

### This is a list of things that I had in my todo list, but I don't remember too much about them, so I will just leave them here for now, might not be relevant anymore

- [ ] Add unpack function to copy files one dir up

```bash
source <(kubectl completion zsh)  # set up autocomplete in zsh into the current shell
echo '[[ $commands[kubectl] ]] && source <(kubectl completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc # add autocomplete permanently to your zsh shell
```
